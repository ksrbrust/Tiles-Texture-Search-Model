## Tiles-Texture-Search-Model
In this project, we will be utilizing the Textures Dataset, which is a comprehensive collection of images showcasing a variety of textures. These textures, diverse in patterns and styles, are analogous to different types of ceramic tiles. This resemblance makes the dataset ideal for our reverse image search model, aimed at assisting in the selection of ceramic tiles based on visual similarity.

The dataset is meticulously organized into two primary folders:

Train Folder: This folder is the core of our training dataset. It comprises images representing a wide array of textures. We will use these images to train our reverse image search model, treating each texture as a unique style of ceramic tile.

Valid Folder: The purpose of this folder is to serve as a validation set. It contains a separate set of texture images, which we will use to evaluate and validate the performance of our model. This step is crucial to ensure that our model can effectively generalize and identify similar textures in new, unseen images.

This dataset's varied range of textures is key to developing a robust and effective reverse image search system.

### Feature Extraction:
Extracting features from each image in the 'train' folder using convolutional neural networks which is suitable for image data.
### Model Validation:
After developing your feature extraction method, we validate our model using the images from the 'valid' folder and visualize it.
### Retrieving and Displaying Results:
Retrieved images by similarity to the query image.
